# AI App Templates Workshop

These guides will help you get started using our AI App Templates along with the Azure OpenAI Proxy.

Here are the available templates with links to their guides:

| Template | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [OpenAI Chat App](openai-chat-app.md) | A simple chat app that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user input. |
| [RAG on PostgreSQL](rag-on-postgresql.md) | A chat app that answers questions using a RAG flow with OpenAI and a PostgreSQL database. |
| [RAG with Azure AI Search](rag-on-ai-search.md) | A chat app that answers questions using a RAG flow with OpenAI and Azure AI Search. |

We recommend going through each template in the order listed, as they build in complexity.
